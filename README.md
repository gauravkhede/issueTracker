Deployed at : https://issuetracker-gaurav.herokuapp.com/
# Tech Stack Used:
## Node.js:
   for server-side scripting.
## Express.js:
   as a backend framework to implement MVC Structure.
  
## MongoDB Atlas:
   as the database for storing all the data related to authors,labels,bugs and projects.
## html5 and css3:
   for designing the front end of the web application.

# Key Features:
  - One can create new projects.
  - Upon creating projects, we can create bugs in that project too and assign labels and authors to it.
  - After adding a new bug, we can also use filter option by author name to find which bugs are assigned to this author in this particular project.
  - We can have multiple filters (more than 2 ) option to filter projects and it will make our work easy.
  - This project has search options as well as single filter options for projects as required.
